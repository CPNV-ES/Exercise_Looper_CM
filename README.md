You can clone the project while using [git](https://docs.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-a-git-repository-using-the-command-line) or [github-desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop).

### Installing the DBO
- Download the last DBO.sql files [here](https://github.com/CPNV-ES/Exercise_Looper_CM/tree/Github-Modifications/doc/BDD/MPD ).
- Import-it into [mySQL Workbench 8.0](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/).
	- [Import the database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-admin-export-import-management.html/) with the file. 

### Setup and Run
To execute the website with it dependencies, you need to run the *index.php* file.

Personally, we use  [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) as IDE and we execute our different files with [XDebug](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/configuring-xdebug.html#updatingPhpIni/).

After that, it will be theoretically done ! :D
